## Origins and Earth Systems
### Evidence worksheet 01 

[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?  

Where are the main prokaryote habitats located and what is the estimated abundance of prokaryotes in the different reservoires? 

What is the total nutrient and carbon content present in prokaryotes and how do they affect the carbon cycle? 

* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  

The primary methodological approaches used were mainly based on extrapolations of pooled sampling data. The number of prokayotes was estimated using average cellular density multipled by the estimated volume of the respective reservoires (i.e. water quantities, soil amounts, and terrestrial subsurface volumes). The amount of cellular carbon content present in prokaryotes was estimated based on the assumption that the cellular carbon is one-half of the dry weight. 

Aquatic environemnt:  
average cellular density which helped to extrapolate the number of prokaryotes 

Soil:   
- estimated from unpublished studies  
- cellular density + estimated amount of soil on Earth 

Subsurface:  
- assuming average porosity of terrestial subsurface is 3%  
- total prokaryote number was calculated using the average volume of subsurface prokaryote cell and volume of of terrestrial subsurface 

Carbon content:  
- assuming that the cellular carbon is one-half of the dry weight  
- used the dry weight of prokaryote to estimate the amount of cellular carbon present in prokaryotes  

* Summarize the main results or findings.  

The main prokaryotic reservoires are the oceans, soils, and terrestrial subsurfaces. The largest turnover rate of prokaryotes is in the oceans. The total amount of prokaryotic carbon is about 60% to 100%. Prokaryotes contribute the largest amount of phosphorous and nitrogen. The large population of prokaryotes imply that there is a greater chance of mutation, therefore contributing to overall genetic diversity.  

According to Table 5:  
Summary of the number prokayotes in the world is:  
Aquatic habitats: 12x10^28  
Oceanic subsurface: 355x10^28  
Soil: 26x10^28  
Terrestrial subsurface: 25-250x10^28  
Total: 415-640x10^28

Summary of the amount (Pg) of carbon content in prokaryotes is:  
Aquatic habitats: 2.2  
Oceanic subsurface: 303  
Soil: 26  
Terrestrial subsurface: 22-215  
Total: 353-546  

* Do new questions arise from the results?  

What is the significance of the estimated prokaytoic abundance in the different reservoires in relation to their metabolic potential to thrive in those enviroments? 

How can the calculations be used to estimate future events? 


* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  

The authors assumed the experimental approaches used were robust and the data presented were largely obtained by extrapolation, therefore, the values may not have been assessed appropriately. Though the results were impactful, the references provided were not scrutinized and so it raises concerns regardig the reliability of the calculations.  


### Problem set 01
#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  

The primary prokaryotic habits are:  
aquatic habitat/open ocean: 1.2x10^29  
soil: 2.6x10^29  
oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces: 3.8x10^30  

Due to the different nutrient availability and carbon content at the different habitats, the capacity to support life will vary. For example, with a higher amount of nutrent and carbon content, the number of cells will increase. 

* What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  

The estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean is: 5x10^5 cells/mL.

Cellular density for Prochlorococcus is: 4x10^4 cells/mL

Fraction of biomass represented by marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus: (4x10^4 cells/mL)/(5x10^5 cells/mL) = 0.08 = 8%

Prochloroccous is a primary carbon carrier
Given only 8% of cells are supporting trophic level, it implies that there must a high turnover rate to able to support the large biomass. 

* What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?  

Autotroph: uses inorganic carbon as a source of carbon (ie. CO2)  
Heterotroph: uses organic carbon as a source of carbon (must be incorporated into their own cells)  
Lithotroph: uses inorganic chemical as a source of electrons

* Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  

The deep ocean sediments, which are 7km below the sea level. The primary limiting factor would be temperature because the average temperature at this depth is about 125C, which nearly exceeds the upper limit for prokaryotic life. 

limiting factor: temperature - ~125C, ∆C ~22C/km 

Marianna's Trench (lowest) ~10.9km (+/-4.5km)
Mount Everst (highest)

deepest subsurface is 9-10km from sea level 


The deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is Marianna's Trench located 10.9km, with an additional 4.5km below, therefore giving 14.9km below sea level.The primary limiting factor at this depth is temperature because the average temperature at this depth is about 125C, which nearly exceeds the upper limit for prokaryotic life. 

* Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?  

The highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is mount everst, which is 8.8km above sea level. The primary limiting factor at this height would be nutrient availability and temperature. 


* Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth’s biosphere measured in km?  

8.8 (mt everest) + 10.9km (marianas trench) + 4km =~24km 

Assuming Mount Everest is the upmost boundary, and 4.9km below subsurface is the lower boundary: 24km (from highest to lowest)


* How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)  

annual cellular production (cells/yr) = [(population size)/(turnover days)]*365

[(3.6x10^28)/(16)]*365 = 8.2x10^29 cells/year

viruses modulate abundance of cell populations
- also carry accessory metabolic genes (protein encoding genes that play a role in cellular metabolism) --> reprogram
- network of cells is almost like a circuit board -> genes can be reprogrammed by viruses

* What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  

assuming carbon efficiency = 20% [assumption made by authors]
assuming 5-20 femtogram (average 10fg) of C/prokaryotic cell
10fg = ~20x10^-30pg/cell

total number of cells=3.6x10^28 cells

(3.6x10^28) * (20x10^-30pg/cell) = 0.72 Pg in marine heterotrophs 

use a multiplier of 4 in the paper --> 4*0.72= 2.88Pg/year (turnover rate of C)

51Pg C/year, 85% is consumed in photic water --> 51*0.85= ~43Pg C consumed
(43Pg/year) / (2.88Pg/year) = 14.9 or 1 turnover every 24.5 days


* How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  

4x10^-7 mutations/generation
(4x10^-7)^4 = 2.56x10^-26 mutations/generation 
[4 simultaneous mutations in every gene, hence to the poewr of 4]

3.6x10^28 cells
(365 days)/(16 days-generation time) = 22.8 turnovers/year

(3.6x10^28 cells) x 22.8 = 8.2x10^29 cells/year in ocean 

(8.2x10^29 cells/year)*(2.56x10^-26 mutations/generation) 
= 2.1x10^4 mutations/year
= 0.4 hours/mutation (in paper)

though rare to have 4 mutations simultaneously, this shows that this is still occuring frequently (point mutations) --> whole other mobile aspect to microbial genome that is drastically more rapid than the mutation we calculated --> large population sizes = anything is possible.


* Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  

The large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells imply there is an enormous potential to acquire genetic diversity. 


* What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?

### Problem set 02
#### Learning objectives: 
Discuss the role of microbial diversity and formation of coupled metabolism in driving global biogeochemical cycles

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?

The primary geophysical processes and biogeochemical processes include:  
-tectonics and atmospheric photochemical processes  
-geothermal processes, diagenesis, tectoics, erosion mountain building 

Abiotic processes are mainly comprised acid-base chemistry, whereas biotic processes are mainly comprised of redox reactions. Both abiotic and biotic processes are interconnected in ways such that together they set the lower limits on external E required to sustain the cycles. 

* Why is Earth's redox state considered an emergent property?

The Earth's current redox state is reflective of the outcomes of the integrated microbial network interactions. Microbes play a role in catalyzing the thermodynamically constrained reactions present within biolgoical fluxes of major elements via coupled half-cells. Through this, a system of linked element cycling has been created. Geological processes such as tectonics also contribute to the replenishment of elements in the biological fluxes, together, these biogeochemical processes alter the Earth's redox state. The notion of Earth's redox state being considered an emergent property implies that microbial units collectively come together to form an interconnected network of metabolic pathways that help create feedbacks links between metabolic and geochemical processes.


* How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?  

-via cycles of coupled oxidation and reduction reactions  
-thermodynamics depends on which side of reaction is favoured  
-products of one nutrient cycle can be funneled to use as the substrates for another nutrient cycle or create a new one

Strategies: using enzymes to catalyze reaction i.e. nitrogenase


* Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox "niches" and microbial groups Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?

+O2: ammonia is oxidized to nitrate  
-O2: nitrite and ntrate are used as electron acceptors to oxidize organic matter and to make nitrogen gas  
-metabolic transformations occur based on thermodynamics  

* What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the recovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?

metabolic diversity: metabolic pathways using available substrates produced as end products of other types of microbial metabolism  

microbial diversity: horizontal gene transfer  

increase in microbial diversity = increase in new genomes sequenced = increase in the number of new protein families  


* On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism? 

Despite the different environmental conditions, microbes have acquired new genetic material through horizontal gene transfer which ultimately allowed them to withstand strong environmental perturbations. In midst of their microbial evolution, core genes coding for redox reactions that contribute to biogeocheical cycles are conserved.  In a sense, new environmental conditions select what microbes survive, but eseential  metabolic pathways are still protected and passed on overtime through the means of boutique genes. 

-evolution of boutqiue genes that protect the metabolic pathway 

###Prompt 1
“Microbial life can easily live without us; we, however, cannot survive without the global catalysis and environmental transformation it provides” (1). From the creation of the solar system to the emergence of homo sapiens, microbes have served important roles in shaping the direction of evolution. As the pioneers of early Earth, microbes have altered biogeochemical transformations and created habitable environmental conditions for humans to live in. Throughout the 4.6 billion years of evolutionary changes, microbes have displayed enormous adaptive potentials and strong resilience as reflected in their ability to survive different harsh conditions. To date, given the sheer abundance of microbes, it simply make them irreplaceable. Microbes collectively are an important entity for maintaining human survival. They are the key players in paving the path for human life. The interconnected microbial networks are essential in restoring balances between the different nutrient cycles. Waste management and environmental efforts are also dependent on the contribution by microbes. Also, despite an increase in technological advances, ties to microbial transformations can still not be entirely delineated.  

Microbes play an essential role in paving the path for human life. They were the pioneers in providing Earth with habitable conditions. Oxygen, for instance, is a key molecules that is necessary for human survival. Approximately 2.3 billion years ago, cyanobacteria were responsible for introducing oxygen into the atmosphere (4). Till present day, presence of all oxygen we breathe is largely attributed to the works of microbes (4). As such, microbial contribution to the overall global atmospheric evolution is another reason for their primitive role in setting up conditions favourable to support life. For example, Kasting states that the microbial population is responsible for the atmospheric evolution of inhabited planets (4). In the event of another global atmospheric change, microbial contribution cannot be excluded (4).  Especially in the consideration of potential habitation on Mars, microbes will certainly be necessary. If there continues to be an increase of habitat loss and overexploitation, it is plausible that Earth would be subjected into a “sixth mass extinction event” (5).  Another reason is microbes are required for the conservation of essential biogeochemical pathways. They are extremely robust and resilient, and relies on horizontal gene transfer that ultimately allows accessory genes to survive to conserve important metabolic pathways (6).  
 
Microbial catalysis and functions are crucial for maintaining equilibrium between the different elemental cycles. For example, an active biosphere relies on nitrogen fixation to integrate nitrogen into biological molecules (2). On an industrial scale, the Haber Bosch process fulfills this need as it has been widely used to mass produce ammonia using nitrogen and hydrogen (2) . Despite it being one of the main anthropogenic inputs of fixed nitrogen, in the absence of any microbial catalysis the atmospheric reserves of nitrogen and hydrogen would presumably be depleted overtime. Consequently, nitrogen would be sequestered in deep sediments which would otherwise necessitate difficult deep sea engineering. On an environmental scale, plants would deplete fixed nitrogen and photosynthesis would eventually stop proceeding (3). However, the nitrogen cycle is restored by microbes for they permit the process of denitrification and anammox to occur, thereby closing the loop by returning nitrogen gas into atmosphere (2). The restoration of balance is also necessary for the continuation of biogeochemical cycles.  

Environmental and waste management efforts would be rendered futile in the absence of microbial catalysis. With respect to nutrient and biomass cycling, microbes are important in ensuring a continuous cycling of nutrients to prevent their exhaustion. In addition, they are on guard for renewing biomass to avoid the accumulation of biomass and addition to the existing amount of biogeochemical waste (3). For example, phosphorus is a type of non-renewable biomass. The lack of regeneration of phosphorous can negatively affect ocean productivity and perturb the balance maintained between human inputs (3). Due to the sedimentation of phosphorous, it is extremely difficult to release the sequestered phosphorus in an environmentally sustainable way, and therefore once again necessitating the activity of microbes (3). Environmental efforts are underway to combat the increasing levels of carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are greenhouse gases. The fact that “levels of carbon dioxide have grown at an extraordinarily rapid rate” and with methanes showing “similar rapid burst” are reflected by increased fossil fuel production and animal respiration (7). As an effort to remedy the effects of climate change, methods such as genetically modified organisms and geoengineering are being introduced (8).  

With an increase in technological advancements, the prospects of replacing the work of microbes is still underway. The act of symbiosis, for example, is a prime example for showing why it is difficult to completely delineate associations from microbes. Symbiosis relationships may include but not limited to nutrient acquisition and or production.  Since humans are composed of microbes, it is a rather contradictory thought to put forth about surviving without microbes when it is not possible for humans separate from their own entities. Also, the feasibility regarding to the time scale and resilience of technology are also factors that need to be taken into consideration. With reference to the evolutionary development of microbial metabolism, the ability for technology to replicate the same machineries following the same time scale remains uncertain. This thought is especially challenged by complications in technological systems as they are “vulnerable to rare but consequential failures” (8). In additional, knowledge regarding the details of how individual processes interact in complex biogeochemical cycles are not well understood (1). Based on this, it seems naive to consider replacing these cycles that produce massive amounts of nutrients with “machines” that are still open for further understanding.  

In conclusion, microbes adapt to environments that favour them and create habitable conditions to support life forms. Many of the different elemental cycles are maintained at equilibrium due to the interconnected microbial network interactions. Efforts in environmental and waste management are also dependent on microbes to help in nutrient and biomass renewal. Despite an increase in the use of technology to replace microbial functions, doubts still arise with regards to the feasibility in time and resilience. Many of the biogeochemical processes require further study to understand individual processes involved, therefore there is still a long way to replace microbial functions with technology confidently.
